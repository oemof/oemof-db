v0.0.6 (2019-12-03)
+++++++++++++++++++

Testing
#######

  * Testing is now done via `pytest`_ instead of `nose`.

.. _pytest: https://pypi.org/project/pytest/


Bug fixes
#########

  * This release should finally get rid of `issue #28`_.

.. _issue #28: https://github.com/oemof/oemof.db/issues/28


Other changes
#############

  * Switched to a `src` based repository layout. This is done via a
    special `packaging template`_ helping with a lot of stuff. Most
    importantly it helps with correct test isolation so that `issue
    #28`_ can properly be tested against.
